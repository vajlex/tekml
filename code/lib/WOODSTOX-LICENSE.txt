Licensing

Woodstox is dual-licensed under 2 alternative Open Source/Free licenses: LGPL 2.1 and ASL 2.0. (starting with Woodstox 2.0 release). This is because of perceived incompatibility between these two popular licenses: while I do not agree in that there is a problem (the way I interpret LGPL, Java class loading is not static linking, ergo there is no virality), I nonetheless find it easier to just provide alternative downloads to risk alienating Apache/Jakarta or GPL users.

What this means is that one can choose either one of these licenses (for purposes of re-distributing Woodstox; usually by including it as one of jars another application or library uses) by downloading corresponding jar file, using it, and living happily everafter. With source code distribution licensing does not matter; except that it is good to know that by default Ant will build 2 distributions, one under each license.
